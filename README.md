Agriculture plays a crucial role in global food security, but crop diseases can significantly reduce yields and impact farmers' livelihoods. Early detection is essential for timely intervention and effective disease management, which helps prevent the spread of infections and minimizes crop loss. CropGuard AI aims to empower farmers by providing them with an easy-to-use tool that ensures early detection and helps them take preventative actions that safeguard their crops.

CropGuard AI utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to analyze images and distinguish between different disease types. The system is built using Flask for the backend, TensorFlow for model training and prediction, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly web interface. Users can upload images of plant leaves to receive instant feedback on disease classification. The project is designed to be efficient, with a structured dataset that includes training, validation, and test data, ensuring reliable performance and high accuracy.
